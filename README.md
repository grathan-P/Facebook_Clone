# Facebook Login Page UI Clone

This project is a responsive UI recreation of Facebook’s login/sign-up page, built using **HTML** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
The primary focus of this project is understanding layout structure, mobile-first responsiveness, and footer wrapping behavior.

## Tech Stack
- **HTML5**
- **Tailwind CSS**

## Responsiveness
The layout adapts across breakpoints:
- **Mobile:** Single-column, centered content
- **Tablet:** Improved spacing and readability
- **Desktop:** Two-column layout with constrained width

Footer links wrap naturally instead of shrinking, ensuring readability on all screen sizes.
